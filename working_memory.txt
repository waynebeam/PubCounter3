Later: One day maybe, take all the combined screen logic, like the back button on top, box layout, etc, and make it a like "screen template" class that the other screens inherit.

Next Up: Make the search button on the tags screen work. This should just be importing the logic from PubCounter 2 to
find all the matches, then I'll just create the names list screen with that list of names.
